# Compose Programming Language

*Compose* is an experimental programming language. It aims to be:

* teachable: minimize boilerplate and incidental complexity
* scalable: work well from one liners to million line systems
* modern: try not to ignore the myriad lessons we've learned in PL over the last fifty years
* powerful: provide high-level and meta-programming capabilities
* precise: sane semantics are king, minimize concessions to legacy

Compose also prioritizes a lot of things other programming languages don't even address as
problems. For more details, read the [manifesto] and [FAQ].

## Status

Work is currently underway on [C0](c0), the Compose Mark Zero compiler. Multiple marathons remain
to be run before I get anywhere close to the lofty ideals in the manifesto, but I've hopefully got
a few more decades before I die, so I feel good about my chances of achieving them.

## Contact

Compose is being created by Michael Bayne <mdb@samskivert.com>. Feel free to contact me if you like
to talk about the utter insanity of trying to foist another programming language on the world.
