*Compose* is an experimental programming language. It aims to be:

* teachable: minimize boilerplate and incidental complexity
* scalable: work well from one liners to million line systems
* modern: try not to ignore the myriad lessons we've learned in PL over the last fifty years
* powerful: provide high-level and meta-programming capabilities
* precise: clear semantics are important, minimize concessions to legacy

Compose also prioritizes a lot of things other programming languages don't even acknolwedge as
problems. For more details, read more about my [goals](goals/) for Compose, and the [FAQ](faq/). If
you just can't get enough of my ranting, you might also like my [manifesto](posts/manifesto/).

## Status

Work is currently underway on [TSCE0](https://github.com/samskivert/compose/tree/master/tsce0), the
Compose Compiler and Editor Mark Zero (TypeScript incarnation). Multiple marathons remain to be run
before I get close to completing my myriad goals, but I wager I've got a few more decades before I
die, so I feel good about my chances of achieving them.

## Contact

Compose is being created by Michael Bayne &lt;<mdb@samskivert.com>&gt;. Feel free to contact me if
you like to talk about the utter insanity of trying to foist another programming language on the
world.

## Code

Compose is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/samskivert/compose), so you can see it grow in all
its fitful, misdirected glory.
